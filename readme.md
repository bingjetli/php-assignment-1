# Overview

This project is a demo of an idea I had envisioned for intuitively finding cocktail items for a Bar/Restaurant POS System. The assignment was to familiarize myself with the PHP language as well as using it to develop web applications connected to an SQL database. I decided to use this opportunity to both test out my idea as well as learn PHP in the process.
